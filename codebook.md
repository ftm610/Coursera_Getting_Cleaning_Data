run_analysis.R output (tidy.txt) codebook
==============================

**subject** = subject id from raw subject_temp.txt and subject_train.txt files  

**activity** = description from activity_label.txt joined to y_test.txt and y_train.txt data  


**ALL OTHER variable names were modified from their raw formats in features.txt**  

Variable names output to tidy.txt are automatically generated by run_analysis.R to be unique and valid.  Output also depends upon the select statement used to filter "mean" and "std" variables only (see README.md).  

Since output variable names are automatically generated and can potentially be modified, they are not permanently documented here.  

All variable names in tidy.txt are matched to their original raw names and written to codebook.txt when the code runs.  

Use codebook.txt generated by run_analysis.R to match variable names in tidy.txt to the descriptions included with the downloaded raw data in: README.txt, features.txt and feature_info.txt.  

Numbers reported here are mean values of previously summarized data (mean and standard deviation).
