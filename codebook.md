tidy.txt codebook
==============================

**subject** = subject id from raw subject_temp.txt and subject_train.txt files  

**activity** = description from activity_label.txt joined to y_test.txt and y_train.txt data  


**ALL OTHER variable names were modified from their raw formats in features.txt**  

*Variables output to tidy.txt are automatically generated and depend upon the select statement (see README.md).  

*Since output variable names are automatically generated and can be modified, they will not be documented here.  

*All variables in tidy.txt are written to codebook.txt when the code runs and are more correct than hard documenting all variable names here.

*Use codebook.txt generated by run_analysis.R to match variable names in tidy.txt to descriptions included with the downloaded raw data in: README.txt, features.txt and feature_info.txt.
